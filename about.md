# About The Explorer's Blog

I'm an  explorer that loves to write and share stories. Before space travel was made accessible to the main public, I always had dreams of adventures so I explored the world as we know it. Now that I have my own space ship, the area to explore expanded infinitely. Now, I want to share my amazing journey across the stars with everyone, showcasing the joys of exploration along with the danger that can come from it.
