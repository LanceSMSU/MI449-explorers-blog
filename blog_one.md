{% blogPost 'Log #1: My First Week of Adventure' 'Lance Stemple' %}

My first week of adventure was quite eventful and honestly a little bit stressful. Before leaving, I had to ensure that my spaceship had all the neccessary materials. Obviously, without food and water, I wouldn't be able to sustain my antics so to combat this issue, I worked with a wonderful friend of mine to install a fully automated hydroponics garden in my spaceship. It grows everything from peppers to corn. Along with this, I bought numerous cases of water and other drinks that could last me for around two years without needing to restock. After saying goodbye to my friends and family, I took off into the stars and traveled for numerous light years away, in search of something brand new.

After a five days of travel, I realized that I had made a huge lapse in judgement. I forgot to pack fuel for the ship. I discovered this issue when I woke up one morning while my ship was on autopilot and discovered that I could see my own breath. This was a massive problem. With the interior of the ship being so cold, my garden wouldn't be able to produce food. Sure, I had some snacks and other food to last a day or two, but after that, I would be in dire need of my garden. After five days of constant travel away from Earth, I didn't want to turn back to restock, but I didn't have much of a choice. I went to turn around my ship only to be shocked that I didn't have enough fuel for the way back and discovered I didn't have any in stock to refuel. With the only planet around being the freezing cold blue planet in front of me, I needed to decide a course of action quickly. I could turn back, but I would run out of fuel and be stranded. I decided my only option is to descend onto the icy planet and try my luck.

Entering the planet's atmosphere, I didn't see much. This was quite a large planet, and all there seemed to be was cold icy mountains and plains. Despite this, I couldn't give up with my life on the line. I spent a full day traveling on the surface and was starting to give up when I finally saw something.

I was shocked to see smoke on the distant horizon. Could this place really be occupied? I drove my ship across the surface to get closer, and sure enough, there was a lonely hut sitting in the valley of a long icy plain. Desperate for any assistance, I landed nearby and put on my suit. I walked up to the door of the hut and knocked. A few seconds later the door opened and I saw my first alien.

Tune in next week to see who it is! (Spoiler: If you can't tell, they saved my life)
