{% blogPost 'Log #2: My First Friend From Another World' 'Lance Stemple' %}

After anxiously waiting for whoever was in the hut to answer my knock, the door creaked open to reveal something that I wasn't prepared to see. A purple humanoid figure answered the door and after a moment of silence and processing from the both of us, he let me in.

The alien, who I later learned to be named Zara, was actually stranded on this planet. Unlike myself, Zara had a load of fuel, but no working ship to fuel. This meant that we had a very lucky situation for the both of us. By using my ship and Zara's supplies, we were able to load up the ship with various supplies that Zara had and leave the cold and barren ice-scape.

Once we flew out of the cold region, we talked for a while. I was very curious about his past, as this was the first intelligent figure I had ever met that wasn't a human. Just like me, Zara was also an explorer. He had a similar background in a sense that he had a thirst for adventure and wanted to see the universe in its entirety. He seemed to be just as captivated by me as I was with him, and he would ask me questions about what Earth was like. We decided that since we both seemed to have the same goals in mind, we would join forces and explore the galaxy together.

Not only did this make exploring much more fun, but life on the ship improved drastically. In addition to having someone to talk to, we were able to split up chores around the ship such as maintaining the garden.

Writing this now, I'm excited to share our adventures across the galaxy and maybe we will even grow our expedition crew! Whatever might happen, I hope you're enjoying my journey just as much as I am.

Stay tuned for next week's adventures and I'll see you next time!
